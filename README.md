### Project Features

The system allows two types of users: Admin and Staff. Admin is at the top of the hierarchy and all the staff are below admin. No further hierarchy is maintained for the staff due to simple policies of a grocery shop. Due to this hierarchy, the features of “Staff”  will just be the subset of the features of “Admin”.
