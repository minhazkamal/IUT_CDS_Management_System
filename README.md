# IUT_CDS_Management_System

The given project is a shop  management system that is labeled to be used in IUT CDS but its basic structure will enable it to be used in almost any regular grocery shop after some modification and adjustment according to the business requirements and policies. The system will automate most of the frequent yet important tasks of the user i.e the shopkeeper and at the same time make shopping more fast and convenient for the customers.

#Features
The system allows two types of users: Admin and Staff. Admin is at the top of the hierarchy and all the staff are below admin.
